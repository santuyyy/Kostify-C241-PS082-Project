# Kostify-Background

This project focuses on finding the ideal place to live, which is often challenging for some people. High rental costs, fewer strategic locations, and inadequate facilities are the main obstacles to the boarding house search process. To solve this problem, we introduce “Kostify,” a smart boarding house search application specifically designed to make it easier for a user to find a place to live that suits their needs and preferences. Kostify combines advanced technology with a smart and user-friendly interface. This app can provide the right boarding house recommendations based on location, price, facilities, and other preferences the user wants.


## Kostify-Machine Learning

As the Machine Learning Cohort, our task in this project was to collected and pre-processed the data set, created a machine learning model, and optimized and evaluated the model to ensure its accuracy and efficiency.
